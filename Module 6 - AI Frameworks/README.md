## AI Frameworks
Several Open-source platforms provide a cost-effective and flexible way to develop AI applications. They offer a wide range of tools and frameworks that can be customized and integrated into your application workflow.


## LangChain
https://www.langchain.com/

LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications that integrate with large language models (LLMs). It provides tools and abstractions to manage the complexities of working with LLMs, such as prompt engineering, chaining multiple LLM calls, and integrating with external data sources. LangChain aims to make it easier for developers to build powerful, language-driven applications with minimal effort.
